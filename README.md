## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the combination of CNNs with Genetic Algorithms to enhance model performance. Through this integration, we explore the effectiveness of using GA for hyperparameter optimization, model fine-tuning, and overall enhancement of machine learning models.

The project includes:

- A detailed explanation of the CNN and GA integration.
- Flowcharts and diagrams to illustrate the model architecture and processes.
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics and comparison tables.
- Instructions on setting up the environment and running the project on a local system.

## **Features**

- **CNN Implementation:** Detailed code for CNN model setup and training.
- **Genetic Algorithm Integration:** Application of GA for optimizing CNN hyperparameters.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Metrics and comparisons to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
- **Diagrams and Flowcharts:** Visual representations of model architectures and processes.
- **Step-by-Step Guides:** Instructions for environment setup, model training, and evaluation.

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (for running the JavaScript-based environment)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **Live Server Extension** (for running the HTML files locally)
- **Text Editor** (like VSCode or Sublime Text)

## **Installation**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [Your GitHub Repository Link Here]
   cd [Your Repository Name]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   - If there are any dependencies listed in a `package.json` file, install them using:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up the Environment:**

   - Ensure you have a Live Server extension installed on your text editor.
   - Open the project folder in your text editor.

## **Usage**

1. **Running the Project Locally:**

   - After setting up your environment, navigate to the main HTML file of the project.
   - Right-click on the file and select "Open with Live Server" (or similar option depending on your text editor).
   - The project should now be running on a local server, accessible through your web browser.

2. **Exploring the Code:**

   - The project includes separate files for CNN and GA implementations. Review the `js` files for detailed code listings.
   - For running specific scripts or tweaking parameters, open the corresponding `js` files, make your changes, and refresh your local server to see the updates.

3. **Understanding the Flow:**

   - Refer to the flowcharts and diagrams provided in the repository for a visual understanding of how the models and algorithms interact.
